# google-homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum]
(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This is my first project using html & css to create a webpage. 
It is a replica of Google's home page without the functionalities.

Building it I got a better understanding of:
Creating & organizing files using the command line,
changing the appearance of raw html with css,
nesting elements & positioning them on the page,
& using git to track changes and publish to GitHub.
