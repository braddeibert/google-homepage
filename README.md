# google-homepage
(Done for the Odin Project curriculum)

This is my first project using html & css to create a webpage. 
It is a replica of Google's home page without the functionalities.

Building it I got a better understanding of:
Creating & organizing files using the command line
Changing the appearance of raw html with css
Nesting elements & positioning them on the page
Using git to track changes and publish to GitHub
